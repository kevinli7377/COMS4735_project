<h1>Estimating volumes of colored liquids in transparent, colorless, rotationally symmetric containers</h1>

<h2>Project Introduction:</h2>
<span>The objective of this project is to develop a visual interface for estimating volumes of colored liquids in transparent, colorless, rotationally symmetrical vessels placed on horizontally flat surfaces. For instance, a user may want to determine the volume of Coca-Cola or orange juice in a symmetrical water glass. By supplying the system with a query and a set of reference images of a common vessel containing known liquid volumes, an estimate of the queryâ€™s liquid volume (ml) can be generated. The system estimates the query volume by mapping a 2-dimensional image to a 3-dimensional metric without the need for depth information. During this project, existing research and projects were sampled. <br>Extensive domain engineering and testing was required to ensure a final system success rate of >88.8% in estimating volumes within a margin of +/- 15ml.</span>
